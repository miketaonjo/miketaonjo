👩‍💻 About Me

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data & Artificial Intelligence at 42 School.
Before specializing in AI, I worked for over two years as a Full-Stack Developer in an apprenticeship program, building and maintaining production-ready web applications.

My background combines:
- Strong foundations in low-level programming (C, Unix systems)
- Backend and infrastructure experience (Docker, networking, APIs)
- Machine learning pipelines and experimentation
- lean, modular, and reproducible code practices

I am now looking for an internship in Data / AI / Machine Learning Engineering where I can contribute to real-world ML systems and scalable AI applications.
